# MMath-Dissertation
Repository for Syd Proom's MMath (Hons) Mathematics Dissertation project titled: "The Mathematics Behind Machine Learning & Neural Networks in Autonomous Vehicles"

These files were used to create, train and evaluate all of the models discussed in the dissertation. The models themselves are also featured in this repository however datasets will not be provided here for copyright reasons.

Note: Object detection is using PyTorch whereas other models used Keras.

If any issues with the code occur or you have any questions, please get in contact with me via email: N0788203@my.ntu.ac.uk
